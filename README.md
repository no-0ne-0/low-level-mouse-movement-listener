# low-level-mouse-movement-listener

Had some problems with the mouse listener that comes in the mouse module so i made my own, it's way lower level than i am used to working with and AI was more involved than I’d like, so I’d appreciate any feedback

It's meant to be run in a secondary thread and controlled via a threading event, see example_use.py for a better understanding

I have yet to implement the function to destroy and unregister the visible window it creates, this is just a prototype
